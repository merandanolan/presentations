# The World is Thick <br> with Digital Data

Note:
How many wifi networks do they detect in the room already? inkdroid ici... would be nice if historical friction worked...

Which of these is _closest_ to your expectations? _Furthest_?

### Your Weekly Pattern

collaborative reading with [hypothes.is](http://web.hypothes.is)

making, breaking, & experimenting in class & out

devlog/open notebook with [github](http://github.io)

Note:
annotations not graded: but these can go into your devlog, provide fodder for reflection. I'm not going to compel you to annotate, but it's a way of asking for help as much as anything, or drawing attention etc

---

### Your Responsibilities

- Making feels weird in an academic context. You *must* push.
- I expect things to break. That is the point. You *must* document.
- Documentation without context is meaningless. You *must* read.
- Reading without discussion is silent. You *must* make noise.
- Go against the grain. Digital tech requires submission. You *must* push back!

## PirateBoxes / Libraryboxes

There are at least [two libraryboxes in Ottawa](http://librarybox.us/map.php);<br> Can you find them? What are they sharing?

## Go Break Something!

Note:
proghist tutorials - not graded, but expected because they will enable you to work with the techs that I will show you next week.
