Note:
ask them t-p-s their ideas of history, digital history

### Your Weekly Pattern

collaborative reading with [hypothes.is](http://web.hypothes.is)

making, breaking, & experimenting in class & out

open notebook with [github](http://github.io)

### Your Responsibilities

- Making feels weird in an academic context. You *must* push.
- I expect things to break. That is the point. You *must* document.
- Documentation without context is meaningless. You *must* read.
- Reading without discussion is silent. You *must* make noise.
- Go against the grain. Digital tech requires submission. You *must* push back!
