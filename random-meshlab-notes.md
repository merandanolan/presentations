# Workflow for Kathryn

## ingredients
- meshlab
- sketchup
- sketchfac

## step one: sketchup

Aim: make a frame to hold the image of your GPR and/or resistivity data
- draw a rectangle
- import png file
- attach it to the rectangle
- make the rectangle into a prism
- export as obj and put into it and the texture - the png file - into a new folder

- put your landscape obj & texture for it into that same folder

## step two: meshlab
- import mesh of the landscape (the ojb)
- import your picture frame
- save as > project and give this _ whole process_ a new name
- you now need to move the picture frame so that it is aligned the way you want it. We'll get the orientation right a bit later.
  - select filters > normals, curvatures, and orientation > transform: move, translate, centre
  - tick the preview box
  - slide the sliders slowly and adjust as necessary to get things where you want them.
  - click 'apply' when it's more or less where you want it.
- if the orientation is not right, click the Align tool (a letter a inside a yellow circle)
  - click 'manual rough gluing'
  - click and drag on the model to get it where you want it
  - click 'store transformation'
- click filters > layers > flatten visible layers
- save your project
- export mesh

## step three
- upload it to sketchfab
- you can continue to modify the overall orientation of the model within sketchfab's editor.
