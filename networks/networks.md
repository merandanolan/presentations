## Network Analysis:
### things you ought to know.
#### Also: _Antiquity!_

Note:

---

### if you remember nothing else

+ antiquity and why network methods
+ networks are present even when they're not
  + articulating the relationship(s) is key
+ profound\* concluding thoughts

---

### structures versus agency

### Seeing Networks in Antiquity

### Roads

---
### the ancient world is _relational_, not _territorial_

- points in space, not areas on a plane
- networks of obligations and debts
- human, municipal-as-person, supernatural

---
### agent based models & networks, briefly

- network analysis is static
- re-animate with agent models

---
### So, Now's the Time to Take Some Notes

![](networks/mindmap.png)

---

### do not confuse modes

- one mode (all the same kind of thing, one kind of relationship)
- multimode (different kinds of things, different kinds of relationships)

---

### visualization versus analysis

- analysis & visualization are not the same thing

---

### kinds of centrality

- betweeness
- eigenvector

---

### comparing networks

- degree
- density
- average path length
- clustering coefficient

---

### substructures

- modularity

---

### formation

- small worlds
- preferential attachment
- there are other mechanisms...
