### My Name Is Shawn Graham
## and I am a Failure

Note:
the hook- why is he a failure? what does that even mean? note training as roman archaeologist vs my actual work history. note that blogging in the early 00s was a way for me to feel less like a failure - on the internet, in those days, no one knew you were a dog... so I let it all hang out there. but I want to focus on two particular failures, and why they failed.

## Two Fails:

+ The Parable of HeritageCrowd
+ The Parable of the Welders

### Failure is not the end.


Note:
my training, as a teacher. If i can do this, untenured, contingent, and still survive then there is hope for everyone. I will discuss later how my despair at the loss of heritagecrowd taught me something profound about teaching. But I will tell you now that I'm still wrestling with what the wrestlers taught me - about empathy, about kindess, and about expectations. These two experiences are perhaps the most formative of my evolution as a scholar.

## DH is about Failing in Public

+ failing in public goes against all our training. So why bother?
+ how do you do that _productively_?
+ how do you do it _safely_?
+ and how do you _teach_ it?

Note:
White guy on the internet warnings.

- Jessica Hagy, _This Is Indexed_, 'Two Annoying Problems'

## The Plan for Today

1. technological sublime / big data gothic
2. failing gloriously as strategy to counter this
3. practical pedagogies of fail
4. the humane hack: beyond fail


Note:
or why DH suffers from the two annoying problems

---

<section data-background="tim/neil-cooper-318875.jpg">

**So many books.**

**So little time.**
</section>
Note:
technological sublime - where conception of algorithms as precise and technology working at scope beyond human comprehension meet. (paige c morgan).

---

<div align="left">
#### The world of information is more Gothic <br>than its believers believe, <br>because it is ghostly, <br>silhouette-like, <br>deprived of human sentience
<br>
#### Arnold Weinstein
</div>
<section data-background="uclbigdatagothic/saturn-eating-child.jpg"></section>

Note:
These two reactions - the rejection and wholehearted adoption of magical methods seem to me to be two sides of the same coin. I like the phrase 'big data gothic' to describe this, but Paige's phrasing 'technological sublime' is better.

---

#### "The goal [of the gothic]<br> was to <br>overwhelm <br>the senses,<br> to annihilate<br> 'Self'." - Turley
<section data-background="tim/wanderer.jpg">
</section>

Note:
vista: terrifies us in its sublime vision. I am spending time describing all of this to differentiate 'dh' from 'big data'. If you ever find yourself shrugging and blaming The Algorithm, that's big data gothic; if you find yourself enthusing about the results to the degree that you're able to fit any explanation around the results and make it sound plausible - that's big data gothic.


---

### ...so what?

Note:
we have to understand that DH != rhetoric of big data, or 'machine learning' or 'artificial intelligence' or 'blockchain' and to resist the technological sublime. We are conditioned every day to accept the outcome of the algorithm as neutral, divine even - "I'm sorry sir but the computer says...". in educational terms, its the purely instrumental view of tech education, it's fitting your teaching to what the LMS can do rather than bending the LMS to your will. it goes back to the index card I first showed you: conflating 'big data' with 'dh' is done to disempower you, to make you feel an imposter.

### The Critical Difference:

## Justification versus Discovery

h/t [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/2012/11/discovery-and-justification-are-different-notes-on-sciencing-the-humanities/)

Note:
archaeology had its moment about 20 odd years ago re computation: computation was there to *prove* something! it was all hypothesis testing, sampling strategies, models and the goal: 'mid range theory', something that would bridge the fragmentary evidence to the grand stories about the past we wanted to tell. the archaeology wars were bitter, divisive. there are still the true believers out there, but most now recognize that you do all of these things in a framework of interpretation, that the computation doesn't *prove* anything, in and of itself. instead, it helps tell better v worse stories. the DH versionn of this summed up in this lovely aphorism of trevor owens.

<section data-background="drew/john-t-413908.jpg">
</section>

DH is about discovery

Discovery is about exploration

When we explore we sometimes encounter blind allies

Exploration is necessarily about failure

Note:
'exploration' in a 'TS Elliot, four quartets', know the place for the first time' sense, rather than in a colonial sense.

### Academia is not set up to valorize 'failure'

---

<br><br><br><h2 style="color:black">20 000 articles, and no fail</hr>
<h4><a href="http://graeworks.net/digitalarchae/20000/"> corpus here </a>
<section data-background="failpics/streamgraph-topics-20000.png">

Note:
Do we *ever* talk about research that *doesn’t* confirm an hypothesis? Do we *ever* try to replicate someone else’s study? - 20 000 articles topic model - No topic that explicitly deals with something *not* working - This, despite the processual turn, where you might’ve expected such a beast!



---
![img](failpics/academic-jargon.jpg)

Note:
Framing fail in research & professional practice. tendency to spin, frame as win ; leads to inflated claims of success; to value fail means to not play the academic game as we currently find it.

## The Lunatick Moment

_...or, moving from 'failure' to Failing Gloriously!_

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>![redemption1](failpics/redemption1.png)</th>
    <th align="top">![redemption2](failpics/redemption2.png)</th>
  </tr>
</table>

Note:
-despair post & the response & the framing of what I was doing as perhaps more akin to Bethany’s ideas about our ‘lunatic’ moment. does that moment still exist? I hope it does

## Croxall and Warnick's <br> Taxonomy of Fails

1 - Technological Failure<br>
2 - Human Failure<br>
3 - Failure as Artifact<br>
4 - Failure as Epistemology<br>

Note:
taxonomy. a strategy for productive fails. move from types 1 & 2 to types 3 & 4. continue the parable of heritagecrowd, the welders: the reporting back, the warts-and-all!
Croxall and Warnick, working from the perspective of digital pedagogy, identify 4 kinds of fail
1-4, with examples - one thing not mentioned in any of this is the whiteness and maleness of the internet, and of internet culture. It might be that everything I’m saying is impossibly tainted by the fact I’m a white guy in tech: and I don’t have the necessary perspective to work out whether or not what I’m saying is dangerous or not.
-The first two refer to what happened; the second two refer to our response and how we react to the first two (*if* we react at all). Perhaps there should be a 5th category: 5 - failing to reflect.
set up your learning so that fails 1 and 2 happen, but the *real* learning happens if you can move 'em to 3 and 4!

---

## Failure as Pedagogy

- frameworks and scaffolds
- physical/digital spaces for explorations
- appropriate eyes and audiences
- uncoverage rather than coverage

### Brandon Walsh - 'Frustration is a Feature'

> In DH we often valorize failure and what can be learned from it, but it can be difficult to know how to deal with the feelings associated with it...<br><Br> Beyond the content we teach and the act of learning it - our students are living in states of continual anxiety. To say nothing of the personal, social, or systemic traumas to which many of them have been subjected about which we may never know.

Note:
this is how I failed Marc in the welding class. re my current students - "If I wanted to study computers I wouldn't be taking history". How do I deal with the anxiety now? By focussing on process, rather than product. By insisting on full documentation of what they're doing, _why_ they're doing it, and how they see it _intersecting_ what they read, and their other classes.

---

### HIST3814o as an example

- [fully online](http://craftingdigitalhistory.ca); all CC - manual and [workbook](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca)
- modules arranged in order of a real DH research project
- readings to set context, exercises to build practice
  - exercises pitched at progressively harder/more technical levels
  - ['Push until you fail, then tell us why and what went wrong'](http://site.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/rubric-and-assessment.html#weekly-work)

Note:
Students all have own domains
- Slack for community spaces
- Hypothesis for collaborative readings
- Github for open notebooks
- Unessay for final 'swing for the bleachers' moment

# Wrapping Up

<section data-background="drew/samuel-zeller-336980.png">
<div align="right">
### The <Br>Humane<br> Hack <br><br> Alan Liu
</div>
Note:
DH suffers from being seen as 'cool' or the 'next big thing' or the 'saviour of the humanities'. Lots of people get their knickers in a twist over this. This goes back to what Alan Liu argued about the laws of 'cool' in 2004, of how 'knowledge work' was the 'cool' work, in that it couldn't really be defined. We only know cool when we see it. Hence, 'cool' is the aporia of information: 'cool is information designed to resist information'. Thus, it's also shallow.

artistic practice offers models for dealing - we need to fold artistic ways of knowing into our practice - to my mind, an experimental process based, fail based, way of knowing. that's how we deal with the 'cool' of tech.

### From Science to Art and Back Again - Tim Ingold

> Revisiting science and art: which is more ecological now? Why is art leading the way in promoting radical ecological awareness? The goals of today's science are modelling, prediction and control. Is that why we turn to art to rediscover the humility that science has lost?

Note:
what is big data but the newest tool of prediction and control? 'humility' - regaining humility in our teaching I think is the flip side to recognizing the anxieties that our students have

Note:
- the human in dh embraces the flawed human. resists big data gothic, neoliberal, instrumental use of tech
- entirely possible to do english, hist, etc w tech and for it not to be dh
- break things hard (granny weatherwax break ‘em hard!), also lobsang, rules there to make you think before you break ‘em, in public
