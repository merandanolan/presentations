### My Name Is Shawn Graham
## and I am a Failure

Note:
the hook- why is he a failure? what does that even mean?

## Two Fails:

+ The Parable of HeritageCrowd
+ The Parable of the Welders

---

### HeritageCrowd

---

### The Welders

### Where did I fail?

Note:
Ask for answers. Write'em down somehow. Come back to these responses later.

## DH is about Failing in Public

+ failing in public goes against all our training. So why bother?
+ and how do you do that _productively_?
+ and also, how do you do it _safely_?

Note:
White guy on the internet warnings.

## The Plan for Today

1. technological sublime / big data Gothic
2. failing gloriously as strategy
3. practical pedagogies of fail
4. the humane hack

**So many books.**

**So little time.**
</section>
Note:
why historians interested in large scale approaches to text - roy rosenzweig. scarcity versus abundance. but a big issue: historians pretend that they aren't using digital methods. milligan, illusory order. so they sneak a little magic in, but pretend it's not there, and that way, they can pretend that it doesn't have theoretical implications, that method is theory free, and that they certainly don't have to think about the underlying networks of power and resources that makes this research possible. or to think about keyword search works. or the errors of OCR - Cordell, Quoth the Raven; Shawville Equity

Note:
different sized corpora that historians deal with. relativity of ‘big’. historians not the only ones who pretend like this. 'big' is a moving goalpost. Shopify 'cotton socks' story. Bigger, faster, theory-free, everything will percolate up in the associations and correlations... we've been here before. DO NOT CONFLATE DH WITH BIG DATA

The Spectre of Cliometrics

Note:
an approach associated with economic historians of the late 70s, early 80s. i'm not a historian, not really, but it looks to me to have been paralleled in archaeology with a certain kind of processual thinking where MOAR DATA and frequentist statistics would give us The Answer. Historians reacted against this - since many of them lacked even basic statistical training, such that there are very few economic historians in history departments these days.

<section data-background="uclbigdatagothic/saturn-eating-child.jpg"></section>

Note:
These two reactions - the rejection and wholehearted adoption of magical methods seem to me to be two sides of the same coin. I like the phrase 'big data gothic' to describe this.

####[The Gothic] aimed to produce emotionally vertiginous shocks and thrills;<br> sensations of any kind, in fact, so long as they put the viewing subject - the 'Self' - at the centre of the experience.

Note:
vista: terrifies us in its sublime vision. I am spending time describing all of this to differentiate 'dh' from 'big data'. If you ever find yourself shrugging and blaming The Algorithm, that's big data gothic; if you find yourself enthusing about the results to the degree that you're able to fit any explanation around the results and make it sound plausible - that's big data gothic.


---

The geek in me thrills at the ability to read, and make sense of, thousands of documents at a time.

The pessimist in me worries about what off-loading meaning-making to an algorithm does to our sense of humanity.

Note:
we have to understand what the method does well enough to know when what we're seeing is an artefact of how we've shaped the data, how we've put our thumb on the scales. We are taught every day to accept the outcome of the algorithm as neutral, divine even - "I'm sorry sir but the computer says..."

### The Critical Difference:

## Justification versus Discovery

Note:
archaeology had its moment about 20 odd years ago re computation: computation was there to *prove* something! it was all hypothesis testing, sampling strategies, models and the goal: 'mid range theory', something that would bridge the fragmentary evidence to the grand stories about the past we wanted to tell. the archaeology wars were bitter, divisive. there are still the true believers out there, but most now recognize that you do all of these things in a framework of interpretation, that the computation doesn't *prove* anything, in and of itself. instead, it helps tell better v worse stories. the DH versionn of this summed up in this lovely aphorism of trevor owens.

---

DH is about discovery

Discovery is about exploration

When we explore we sometimes encounter blind allies

Exploration is necessarily about failure

Note:
'exploration' in a 'Sailing to Byzantium' sense, rather than in a colonial sense.

### Academia is not set up to valorize 'failure'

<br><br><br><h2 style="color:black">Fail in the <br>archaeological literature?</hr>
<section data-background="failpics/streamgraph-topics-20000.png">

Note:
Do we *ever* talk about research that *doesn’t* confirm an hypothesis? Do we *ever* try to replicate someone else’s study? - 20 000 articles topic model - No topic that explicitly deals with something *not* working - This, despite the processual turn, where you might’ve expected such a beast! Nb, btw, the long prehistory of ‘digital’ type work in anglophone archaeology: even before the digital was invented, *digital habits of thought* existed. Perhaps these were a necessary precursor to enable digital work to happen in the first place

Note:
Framing fail in research & professional practice. tendency to spin, frame as win ; leads to inflated claims of success; to value fail means to not play the academic game as we currently find it.

## A Taxonomy of Fails

1 - Technological Failure<br>
2 - Human Failure<br>
3 - Failure as Artifact<br>
4 - Failure as Epistemology<br>
<p class="fragment fade-up">5 - Failing to Reflect</p>

Note:
taxonomy. a strategy for productive fails. move from types 1 & 2 to types 3 & 4. continue the parable of heritagecrowd, the welders: the reporting back, the warts-and-all!
Croxall and Warnick, working from the perspective of digital pedagogy, identify 4 kinds of fail
1-4, with examples - one thing not mentioned in any of this is the whiteness and maleness of the internet, and of internet culture. It might be that everything I’m saying is impossibly tainted by the fact I’m a white guy in tech: and I don’t have the necessary perspective to work out whether or not what I’m saying is dangerous or not.
-The first two refer to what happened; the second two refer to our response and how we react to the first two (*if* we react at all). Perhaps there should be a 5th category: 5 - failing to reflect.

## The Lunatick Moment

_...or, moving from 'failure' to Failing Gloriously!_

Note:
-despair post & the response & the framing of what I was doing as perhaps more akin to Bethany’s ideas about our ‘lunatic’ moment. does that moment still exist? I hope it does

---
## Failure as Pedagogy

- frameworks and scaffolds
- physical/digital spaces for explorations
- appropriate eyes and audiences
- uncoverage rather than coverage

# Humane hack - Alan Liu

> The humanities thus have an explanation for the new arts of the information age, whose inheritance of a frantic sequence of artistic modernisms, postmodernisms, and post-postmodernists is otherwise only a displaced encounter with the raw process of historicity. Inversely, the arts offer the humanities serious ways of engaging – both practically and theoretically- with “cool”. Together, the humanities and arts might be able to offer a persuasive argument for the humane arts in the age of knowledge work. (Liu 2004, 381)

Note:
DH suffers from being seen as 'cool' or the 'next big thing' or the 'saviour of the humanities'. Lots of people get their knickers in a twist over this. This goes back to what Alan Liu argued about the laws of 'cool' in 2004, of how 'knowledge work' was the 'cool' work, in that it couldn't really be defined. We only know cool when we see it. Hence, 'cool' is the aporia of information: 'cool is information designed to resist information'. Thus, it's also shallow. Thus the humanities counters the shallowness of 'cool'

# From Science to Art and Back Again - Tim Ingold:

> Revisiting science and art: which is more ecological now? Why is art leading the way in promoting radical ecological awareness? The goals of today’s science are modelling, prediction and control. Is that why we turn to art to rediscover the humility that science has lost?
