<h2 style="color:#069"> Can computers be creative?</h2>

<p style="color:#069">"Computational Creativity is the study and simulation, by computational means, of behaviour, natural and artificial, which would, if observed in humans, be deemed creative."</p>

Note:
Computational creativity is a multidisciplinary endeavour that is located at the intersection of the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, philosophy and the arts. [...] The field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity. Theoretical work on the nature and proper definition of creativity is performed in parallel with practical work on the implementation of systems that exhibit creativity, with one strand of work informing the other.

Note:
contrast this with folks like John Cage or the dice rolling systems to generate music in 18th century, just to point out that there's a deep history here

## These <br>are the<br> Wrong Questions.

Note:
problem with computational creativity research is that it is framed with regard to the human activity of creativity. turing test - acts sufficiently human, it's AI. this is like judging submarines to be swimming. 'do computers think? do submarines swim?' the wrong sorts of questions.

to my mind, it's all back to front. we need to start at the end = the thing created, and understand it on its own terms.

##### Better Questions:
#### What are these things? Why are they way they are? <br> How did they get this way? What do they mean?

Note:
jentery sayers tiffany chan tweet about their bot talk, where they differentiate between play (automata), work (automation), and labour (algorithm). useful framework for understanding the political ends of computational creativity. But today, I want to think about ontology, and what the 'things' created by creative computers, are.

### And what do <br>these answers imply<Br> for us history types?
## What we need, is a framework


Note:
computer made things happen at the edges and boundaries between different kind of computing objects. different software libraries made to interact in novel ways. one kind of data transformation into something else. The act of computation was first called a 'mill' by charles babbage, in the sense that information goes in and gets ground into something else: transformed

to make something computational we have to define boundaries. it is that same process of forgetting that we talked about last week, the necessary forgetting that enables something to be 'encoded'.

archaeologists do this to when they excavate and record the information. some information is forgotten in the process of making something new to think with - and they impose, based on their own vision & training & beliefs boundaries and edges that may or may not have been there in the material world.

these bounded spaces can sometimes contain non-spaces - or create non-spaces. how do we understand the meaning of these voids? I am suggesting to you that computational creativity creates analogous voids in data, from data.

## The Victims of Vesusius
### their lives, afterlives, and after-afterlives

Note:
to understand what comes next, you need to understand a bit about the victims of Mt. Vesuvius.
walk through the entire history, finish up with the ct scans

"What is the ontological status of these casts... are they the interior surfaces of the void? are they only meaningful when they become injected with plaster? Are they obliterated in the process? If you dug away the surrounding rock, would they still be there but simply unbounded and undetectable? when the cast is exhumed, is the void restored?

Note:
pseudomorph: lit. false body - produced in situ through substitution, body replaced with plaster.

![](3812/reilly/reilly.016.jpeg)

Note:
sometimes skeletal remains incorporated within the plaster so can also be considered a reliquary and a fetish. sometimes casts of casts are made, as when presents of casts were sent to museums around the world: these are now effigies.

![](3812/reilly/reilly.023.jpeg)

Note:
as effigies are made in new materials far from organic originals, they are skeuomorphs - form of object in another material or other technique (early iphone app design was skeuomorphic, replicating vinyl turntables, wooden bookshelves etc). also: aura - seems to migrate with these copies, interestingly

### materialization <br>v<br> dematerialization
## and the <br>archaeological<Br> record

Note:
Gavin Lucas (2012) points us away from thinking about digital archaeology (or digital history for that matter) in terms of 'data collection'. For him, to do field archaeology is to actually make or materialize new things: 'interventions' create 'entities'.

deleuze, guattari via delanda
assemblages - both internally and externally systems of relationships - to their environment & other assemblages .  (Normally, archaeologists thing of 'assemblages' as the contextual interrelationships of interior relationships, the things that go in a room, or are found together in the same 4d space).

thus, how these assemblages are assembled into an 'archive' is a process of materialization & dematerialization

permeability v persistence <br> (forces defining the qualities of the object)<br>

enchainment vs containment <Br> (forces defining the processes of assembly / dissassembly)

Note:

materilization & dematerialization can be explored by thinking in terms of permeability v persistence, and enchainment vs containment.

thus we can understand how meanings change by mapping the changing biography of our objects of study against these 2 grid. 2 grids: a grid of forces defining the qualities of objects; a grid of forces defining the processes of assembly & dissassembly

objects or assemblages exist within a grid of materializing & dematerializing forces, where there are qualities of permeability and persistence, and processes of enchainment and containment. 'containment' processes gather things together; enchainment processes are complementary and generate recurring associations (typologies, similar find combinations)

---
![](3812/reilly/reilly.009.jpeg)

Note:
first grid - permeability: how able they are to be materially reconfigured.
persistence: how long they endure.

Note:
second grid: forces of assembly & dissassembly
-materializataion & dematerialization
- colonization & dissipation
- colonization shaped by 'enchainment' versus 'exposure'. Colonization can maintain the material coherence even if the assemblage is removed in time and spaces
- dissipation deals with containment versus dispersal and breaks up the bonds of an assemblage

<h2 style="color:#069"> So what does this have to do with computational creativity? </h2>

Note:
- we now have an ontological framework for understanding these things that computers make, or the things that we make with computers
- this framework forces us to think about the edges of the things we make and/or how they smear. computational creativity work forces us to not see things as bounded, but blurred. there is no point asking if computers can be creative if we have no understanding of the things computers make. We don't know what creativity is in humans, for heaven's sake. But it might be better to think, for the time being, that the computer augments our own creativity - it is a prothesis for thought. so if we turn our focus to the ontological status of things, then we might have a better sense of what they are for, what they mean, and their historiography and thus causal relationships with their entangled humans, machines, and systems

## What is the <br> ontological meaning <br> of *your* projects?
<br>

+ where is the creativity in your models?
+ how do your models fit on these frameworks? why?
+ what do you see when you try to map the moments, the glitches, the voids and spaces?
