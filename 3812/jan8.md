**What does history look like?**

**What does _digital_ history look like?**

Note:
ask them t-p-s their ideas of history, digital history
digital history is about experimentation

Note:
Experimental Archaeology - one of the things we do in archaeology is build/make, to try to understand through making. so i wondered, what would making in history look like? - my sshrc grant i'm writing; makes y'all my collaborators

Note:
Not asking you to do anything I haven't already done, for higher stakes. Critical thing here is the notion of breaking things. Discussion: what have you broken? HeritageCrowd discussion

"making" vs "hacking"

> It's as if 'hacking' has been sanitized and transformed into 'making' - with politics, activism, tactics, history, economics and social issues removed in the process'

[Making Critical Making - Garnet Hertz](http://conceptlab.com/criticalmaking/PDFs/CriticalMaking2012Hertz-Introduction-pp01to10-Hertz-MakingCriticalMaking.pdf)

Note:
Here here's critizing 'Make' magazine for sanitizing hacker work that 'circumvents' infrastructures, or that open up the black box of consumer electronics to see how things actually work

# A quick look at Digital History

<section data-background="3812/lance-anderson-59330.jpg">
    <div align="right">

How do the following<br> break your expectations of history?

[Pembroke Soundscapes](http://pembrokesoundscapes.ca)

[Jamaican Slave Revolt](http://revolt.axismaps.com/map/)

[Sonic Word Clouds](https://programminghistorian.org/posts/sonic-word-clouds)  
- sound file at http://bit.ly/sonic-word-cloud

Note:
discuss!

---

Go to [http://www.heritagejam.org/2017-entries](http://www.heritagejam.org/2017-entries)

Which of these is _closest_ to your expectations? _Furthest_?

Which one is most exciting? Where is the 'History' in it?

---

Your mission is to 'write' history by making.

By translating something physical into the digital and back again.

Your work will look different.

_this is ok_

## Your Weekly Pattern

+ collaborative reading with [hypothes.is](http://web.hypothes.is)
+ open notebook with [github](http://github.io)
+ entry tickets

Note:
show them how to make a note in github. tell them that they can make their course notes there; also, to keep track of things that worked, didn't work, and so on. Show them - https://github.com/sarahmcole/hist3814o/blob/master/july09_module1_faillog.md or https://github.com/sarahmcole/hist3814o/blob/master/Module%201%20Exercise%201%20(1).md

## Markdown

- separate content from container
- write in plaintext
- convert to whatever format is needed

Exercise: [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/)

### Your Responsibilities

- Making feels weird in an academic context. You *must* push.
- I expect things to break. That is the point. You *must* document.
- Documentation without context is meaningless. You *must* read.
- Reading without discussion is silent. You *must* make noise.

Note:
their concerns? The Reward
t-p-s what do they think they'll actually get out of all this
