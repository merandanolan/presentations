### Jan 10 Plan

- have my computer attached to monitor - hdmi cable?

- they keep their tickets (hand to me at end)
- tps for those who have 'em
- five minutes for those who don't to write something down
- snowball it all
- discussion - note that nobody has read the latour article? ok, very few.
  - note that these papers are all written in different technological contexts
    - what do we know about the history and culture of the tools used?
  - show the hypothesis group, ways to explore it, tags
  - also jonudell facet exploration, getting your api, downloading
- dillinger exercise to learn markdown - write up point form on what they've discussed
- github exercise - get that markdown article up into their notebook
